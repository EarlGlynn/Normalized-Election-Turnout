# Parameters

Use first publicly available voter list after a general election whenever possible.

```{r}
ELECTION_DATE    <- params$ElectionDate   # Use for age computations   
AFTER_FILE_DATE  <- params$AfterFileDate                                 
HISTORY_INDEX    <- params$HistoryIndex       
ELECTION_NAME    <- params$ElectionName
```

*Data for `r ELECTION_NAME` Election `r ELECTION_DATE` is from file `r AFTER_FILE_DATE`.*

Registration for Kansas elections closes 21 days before an election. See [Voter Registration Deadlines](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-registration-deadlines.aspx).

Voters registered after that date are excluded from analysis, unless voter history indicates they voted. Thereâ€™s no practical way to resolve such inconsistent data.

```{r}
FigureDistrict <- paste(params$DistrictName, params$District)
FigureTitle    <- paste("Kansas", ELECTION_NAME, "Election", ELECTION_DATE)
Source         <- paste("Source:  Kansas Secretary of State, Voter File ",
                        AFTER_FILE_DATE)
Stamp          <- paste("efg", format(time.1, "%Y-%m-%d %H%M"))
```

# Read Kansas Data

```{r}
afterFilename <- paste0(paste0("E:/Data/Kansas/RawData/",
                               str_sub(ELECTION_DATE, 1, 3), "0s/"),     #####
                        str_sub(AFTER_FILE_DATE, 1, 4), "/",
                        AFTER_FILE_DATE, "/KSCVRID.CSV")
voterList <- readVoterFile(afterFilename) 
nrow(voterList)          
```

## Add `VotedInElection` variable  

```{r}
if (ELECTION_NAME == "Primary")
{ 
  voterList <-
    voterList %>%
    mutate(
            VotedInElection = 
              as.integer(substr(AugPattern, HISTORY_INDEX, HISTORY_INDEX) == "X")
          )
} 

if (ELECTION_NAME == "General")
{
  voterList <-
    voterList %>%
    mutate(
            VotedInElection = 
              as.integer(substr(NovPattern, HISTORY_INDEX, HISTORY_INDEX) == "X")
          )
}
```

## Exclude if registered after 3 weeks before election

```{r}
table(voterList$VotedInElection, voterList$RegisteredTooLate, useNA = "ifany")
```

```{r}
registeredTooLate <-
  voterList  %>%
  filter(VotedInElection   == 0,
         RegisteredTooLate == 1)

nrow(registeredTooLate)
```

```{r}
voterList <-
  voterList   %>%
  filter(VotedInElection   == 1  |
         RegisteredTooLate == 0)

nrow(voterList)
```

# Statewide Summary

```{r}
voterList %>%
  summarize(
             nRecords = n(),
             nID14    = n_distinct(ID14),
             nSOSKey  = n_distinct(SOSKey),
             nVoted   = sum(VotedInElection, na.rm = TRUE),
             nParty   = n_distinct(Party),
             nGender  = n_distinct(Gender),
             nCounty  = n_distinct(County),
             nPrecinct = n_distinct(Precinct),
             minAge   = min(Age, na.rm = TRUE),
             maxAge   = max(Age, na.rm = TRUE)
            )  %>%
  Show(bigMark = ",")
```

When `nSOSKey` > `nID14` there are very likely some duplicate voter records that should be deleted.

Number of voters with age > 105 years old (or missing birthdates):

```{r}
tooOld <-
  voterList  %>%
  filter(Age > params$AgeLimit | is.na(Age))

nrow(tooOld)
```

These "too old" voters (or those without age) written to file `Too-Old-Voters.xlsx'

```{r}
if (nrow(tooOld) > 0)
{
  write_xlsx(tooOld, paste0("Too-Old-Voters-", params$DistrictName, ".xlsx"))
}
```

Any too young?

```{r}
tooYoung <-
  voterList  %>%
  filter(Age < 18)

nrow(tooYoung)
```

```{r}
if (nrow(tooYoung) > 0)
{
  write_xlsx(tooYoung, paste0("Too-Young-Voters-", params$DistrictName, ".xlsx"))
}
```

Voter count after removal of "too young", "too old" and missing age

```{r}
voterList <-
  voterList  %>%
  filter(Age >= 18,
         Age <= params$AgeLimit,
         !is.na(Age))

nrow(voterList)
```

            ActivePercent = 100 * Active / Registered,

            .groups = "drop")   %>%

```

Total number of Registered, Active, Ballots Cast

```{r}
countsRegistered <- sum(ageData$Registered, na.rm = TRUE)
countsActive     <- sum(ageData$Active,     na.rm = TRUE)
countsVoted      <- sum(ageData$Voted,      na.rm = TRUE)

## Normalized Fraction

The normalization is formed by the ratio of turnout by age to the overall turnout for all ages (the dotted line in the diagram above).

What is the intuition for this normalization?

* Normalized fraction < 1 shows ages that "underperformed".

* Normalized fraction > 1 shows ages that "outperformed".

* Normalized fraction can be compared across different districts, like state and county.

```{r}
normalized <-
  ageData    %>%
  mutate(ActiveNormalized = (ActivePercent/100) / overallFractionActive,
         VotedNormalized  = (VotedPercent/100)  / overallFractionVoted)
